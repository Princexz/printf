.SH NAME
_printf - formatted output conversion with number of bytes printed as return
.SH SYNOPSIS

Printf is a variadic function with one mandatory argument format and extra arguments that can be none at all or many.

Its inclusion requires the header\ "main.h".

.B #include \ "main.h"

Its prototype goes as follows:

.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

The function _printf() writes output to stdout, the standard output stream with
the format and options presented below. It uses an internal buffer of 1024 bytes
although it can print larger sets of data.
.TP
.BR Return

Upon succesful execution, this function returns the the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value of -1 is returned.

.TP
\fBFormat of the format string\fR

The format string is a character string starting and ending with double quotes. The format string is composed of zero or more directives; ordinary characters (not %), 
which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion
specification is introduced by character % and ends with a \fIconversion specifier\fR. In between there may be (in this order) zero or more \fIflags\fR, an optional field width, an optional \fIprecision\fR modifier and an optional \fIlength modifier\fR.

The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. By default 
the arguments are used in the order given, where each '*' and each conversion specifier
asks for the next argument (and it is an error if insufficiently arguments are given). Thus

     printf("%d", argument);

.TP
\fBThe flag Characters\fR

.RS
The character % is followed by zero or the following flags.

.IP \fB#\fR
For \fBo\fR conversions the first character of the output string is made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already).
For \fBx\fR and \fBX\fR conversions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" or "0X" respectively added.

.IP \fB0\fR
(Not implemented yet) The value should be zero padded. For \fBd\fR, \fBi\fR, \fBo\fR, \fBu\fR, \fBx\fR, and \fBX\fR 
the converted value is padded on the left with zeros. If the \fB0\fR and \fB-\fR flags both appear, 
the \fB0\fR flag is ignored. If a precision is given with a numeric conversion, the \fB0\fR flag is ignored.

.IP \fB-\fR
(Minus sign, not implemented yet) The converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary, (Default is right 
justification) and padded with blanks in the right rather than on the left with blanks 
or zeros. This flag overrides \fB0\fR if both are given.

.IP\fB\ '\fR\ \fB\ '\fR
(Blank Space) The argument is padded with a single blank space before a positive number 
or empty string produced by a signed conversion.

.IP \fB+\fR
A sign (+ or -) should always be placed before a number produced with a signed conversion.
By default, only negative numbers have this sign.


.RE
.TP
\fBThe field width\fR

An optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit) specifying a minimum field width.
If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it will be padded with
spaces on the left if the flag \fB-\fR is not present, and on the right if it is present.
A character \fB*\fR can be used instead of a decimal string. In this case, an argument passed to 
the function will be taken as the width value.

  printf("%5d", num);

  or

  printf("%*d", width, num);


.TP
\fBThe precision\fR

An  optional  precision,  in  the  form  of a period ('.') followed by an optional decimal digit string.
A negative precision is taken as if the precision were omitted. This gives the minimum number of digits to 
appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions,  or the  maximum  number of characters to be printed from a string for s and S conversions. A character
* can be used instead of a  decimal string. In this case, an argument passed to the function will be taken as the precision value.

  printf("%.3d", num);

  or

  printf("%.*d", precision, num);


.TP
\fBThe length modifier\fR

.RS
.IP \fBl\fR
An integer conversion to a \fIlong int\fR or \fIunsigned long int\fR argument.

.IP \fBh\fR
An integer conversion to a \fIshort int\fR or \fIunsigned short int\fR argument.


.RE
.TP
\fBThe  conversion specifier\fR

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied, as follows:

.RS
.IP \fBd,\ i\fR
The argument \fIint\fR is converted to a signed decimal notation. If precision is present,
it gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires
fewer digits, then it is padded with zeros on the left. Default precision is 1.

.IP \fBo,\ u,\ x,\ X\fR

The argument is converted to unsigned octal (\fBo\fR), unsigned decimal (\fBu\fR), 
or unsigned hexamedical (\fBx\fR and \fBX\fR) notation. The letters \fBabcdef\fR 
are used for \fBx\fR conversion and the letters \fBABCDEF\fR are used for \fBX\fR
conversion. If precision is present, it will give the minimum number of digits that 
must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, then it will be padded with 
zeros. By default the precision is 1.

.IP \fBc\fR
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR and the resulting character is written. The representation of characters is based off the ASCII coding.

.IP \fBs\fR
The argument received is expected to be a pointer type \fIchar *\fR to an array of characters.
Characters from this array are printed up to (but not including) a null byte \ ('\\0'). 
If precision is specified, then this will determine how many characters are taken into 
account for printing.

.IP \fBp\fR
A \fIvoid *\fR pointer argument is printed as hexadecimal in lower caps representing 
an adress in memory.

.IP \fB%\fR
A \fB\ ' %\ '\fR character is written and no conversion is made. The specification is 
as follows: \fB%%\fR.

.IP \fBb\fR
The argument is converted to an \fIunsigned int\fR value and then operated to get its 
binary representation (base 2).

.IP \fBS\fR
The argument received is expected to be a pointer type \fIchar *\fR to an array of characters.
Characters from this array are printed up to (but not including) a null byte \ ('\\0'). 
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \fB\\\fR\fBx\fR, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters).

Example:  _printf("%S\n", "Alx\nSchool");

Output: Alx\x0ASchool.

.IP \fBr\fR
The argument received is expected to be a pointer type \fIchar *\fR to an array of characters.
Characters from this array are printed in reverse order up to (but not including) a null byte \ ('\\0').

.IP \fBR\fR
The argument received is expected to be a pointer type \fIchar *\fR to an array of characters.
Characters from this array are encoded to ROT13 and printed in order up to (but not including a null byte \ ('\\0').

.SH BUGS

The field width and precision modifiers are still in development, so there may be flaws with their functions. The flags (-) and (0) are yet to be implemented.
